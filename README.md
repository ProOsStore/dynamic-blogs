# Dynamic Blogs
<h2>A dynamic blog generator with only Html, Css, Js and Json using Github API.</h2>
<h4>In this site there is just a index.html file which uses Bootstrap for styling and script.js for loading json file and displaying it in index.html file. If you see the json file you'll surprise cause the json file is empty, if you have a basic knowledge of json file we use it to store the data and use js to retrieve data but in our condition it's our secondary step our primary step is we have a editor and the editor file are index.html, editor.css, editor.js. In this index.html file i have just made a input fields just to enter the information in it now here the actual magic happens the js files start working when user saves the post the js file updates the empty json file with the post data here comes the important part it is possible only with the help of Github API.</h4>
